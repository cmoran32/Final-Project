Comments about the project:
I definitely found that in doing this project it was definitely a lot more complicated than I thought it was going to be. I did not realize how confusing and cluttered it was going to get by doing a choose your own adventure game. About halfway through I was getting confused as to where I had left off and I had to go back through and add in some comments to remind me what certain lines where. I also had definitely thought I was going to be able to add more paths to take, but even just adding the one pretty much doubled the amount of work I had to do.
