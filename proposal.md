# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Road to the League

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project is going to be a code for a choose your own adventure game with different choices and endings 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software is going to bring a player through the life of an aspiring NHL prospect. As this character, the player will be able to make different choices that affect how they play in games and how they affect the people around them on their journey. This game will pose the player with situations that will have 2 choices. Based on the players choice they will progress through the story to eventually reach the different endings. When the player picks a choice the game will continue down that certain path allowing them to continue the game or in some cases find that they made a bad choice and can progress towards a less than favorable endings. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I would say that a good outcome for this game is that it will run without bugs and will also have at least 2 different endings (1 good and 1 bad)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Multiple endings will work and the game will not have to but cut short due to time contraints 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game will have plenty of different endings and a long storyline to keep the player engaged

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

As a next step I will have to research how to even create a choose your own adventure game and figure out how to apply my idea into an actual game. I will need to also be very careful about making mistakes as the game could get confusing the more paths I create. I will have to learn how to keep everything organized for the game.
